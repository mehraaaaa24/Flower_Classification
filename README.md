Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project involves building an Image Classification model to identify fruits and vegetables using Deep Learning in Python with TensorFlow. The process starts by pre-processing the image dataset, reading the images from folders, and converting them into arrays. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is then built using multiple layers, trained on the dataset, and evaluated to measure performance. Once trained, the model is deployed as a web application, allowing users to upload images for classification.
